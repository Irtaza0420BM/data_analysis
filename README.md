# Manhwa Hair Color Disparity Analysis

## Introduction
The primary goal of this analysis was to examine the hair color disparity between Male Leads (ML) and Female Leads (FL) in various manhwas. Initially, the project was started to explore the differences in hair colors between these two groups, but as I went through the data, I got interested in exploring manhwas based on different keywords, like "North Duke" or "Villainess." If you're a fan of these genres, you can search for your favorite manhwa based on specific keywords!

## Source Data
You can find the updated data list [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fbUy7wefv31I_NQ4fzrAuBFMNZI6VJLF5qz3ZKr3kzA/edit?gid=1619391106#gid=1619391106). 

Since I was having some trouble reading the sheet and, frankly, was too lazy to copy it into my own drive and use the Google Developer Console API to extract the actual data, I downloaded the CSV versions for ease of use. You can download the CSV files too!

## Analysis Purpose
- The original purpose of this analysis was to see the disparity in hair colors between Male Leads (ML) and Female Leads (FL).
- However, while reading through some of the manhwa names, I found myself interested in some and decided to create a search function that finds manhwas based on keywords. You can now easily search for manhwas related to popular tropes like "North Duke" or "Villainess."
